## **DESCRIPTION**<br>
Sabanci University CS210 Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project. This project will be an analysis on my coffee drinking habits.<br><br>
All the coding material that i have used is available on githup repository<br>

## **MOTIVATION**<br>
  This project's goal is to examine my coffee consumption patterns and how they impact my everyday activities. It also aims to determine how outside variables, such as location, exam weeks, and weather, affect my coffee preferences. Coffee plays a crucial role in my routine, acting as both a productivity booster and a comfort beverage. By studying these patterns, I aim to identify the underlying triggers and impacts of my coffee habits on my life and help me make more informed decisions about my coffee consumption.

## **DATA SOURCES**<br>
The datas that I plan to use in my project:
1. Starbucks Data: 
* Includes transaction history, such as purchase dates, times, locations, and the number of loyalty stars earned or redeemed.
* This data provides a record of my coffee consumption behavior over time.
2. Health Application Data:
* I use my Health application to track my step count, I extracted my step counts combined them according to date and will compare it with my Starbucks data.
* This analysis will help me understand how coffee consumption correlates with my physical well-being and productivity.
3. External Data:
* Weather data of the corresponding dates (temperature, precipitation, etc.) collected from online sources.
* Exam schedules and course schedule, workload information (manually recorded).
* Location contexts (e.g., home, university, or travel) based on Starbucks transaction locations.

## **OBJECTIVES**<br>
This project aims to:
1. Gain Insight About My Consumption Patterns:
* Analyze when, where, and how frequently I consume coffee.
2. Evaluate Impact of Coffe on Daily Activities:
* Examine the impact of coffee consumption on my daily activity.
3. Analyze External Factors:
* Explore the effects of  outside factors like weather, exam weeks,different weekdays and locations affect my coffee drinking habits.
* Find out whether certain situations (such as stressful weeks or different wheather conditions) affect how much coffee I consume.

## **METHADOLOGY**
* Combine Starbucks transaction data with health app metrics and external data sources (weather and exam schedules).
* Ensure all datasets are consistent, fill in missing data points, and align timestamps.
* Visualize coffee consumption trends over time.
* Conduct a detailed analysis of trends, identifying patterns as well as unusual spikes or drops in coffee consumption.
* Identify correlations between coffee habits, daily activities, and external factors.
* Use statistical techniques to quantify relationships (e.g., regression analysis between coffee and health metrics).
* Summarize key findings about my habits and the role coffee plays in my daily life.

## **FINDINGS**
**Seasonal and Hourly Coffee Patterns**<br>
My coffee consumption fluctuates throughout the year, peaking in the fall months (e.g., October and November) and declining during the summer. The most active time for coffee consumption is around 1 PM, with another peak in the late morning between 10 AM and noon, suggesting I rely on coffee for an energy boost during these periods. Early mornings and late evenings show minimal coffee activity.

**Coffee and Physical Activity**<br>
I take significantly more steps on coffee-drinking days compared to non-coffee days. This could indicate that coffee consumption motivates me to be more physically active, or that I tend to drink coffee on busier, more active days.

**Impact of Location**<br>
I drink noticeably more coffee at Sabancı University compared to other locations, likely due to a more structured daily routine or greater availability of coffee on campus.

**Exam Weeks vs. Non-Exam Weeks**<br>
Despite the expectation of higher consumption during exam weeks, my coffee habits remain relatively stable, with no significant difference in stars earned compared to non-exam weeks. This suggests my coffee consumption is less influenced by academic stress than anticipated.

**Weekday vs. Weekend**<br>
I consume more coffee on weekdays than weekends, possibly reflecting the demands of a structured weekday schedule compared to a more relaxed weekend routine.

**Temperature and Coffee Consumption**<br>
Temperature does not significantly affect my coffee habits, as I drink similar amounts on days above and below 20°C. This suggests my coffee consumption is not seasonally influenced by weather conditions.

## **LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK**
One limitation of my analysis is that it primarily tracks coffee from Starbucks, while I occasionally consume coffee from other sources, such as home-brewed or other cafes. Expanding my dataset to include all coffee sources would provide a more complete picture of my habits. <br><br>
Additionally, I plan to incorporate other factors like sleep quality, mood, and stress levels to better understand how these variables influence my coffee consumption. In the future, I aim to build predictive models to forecast my coffee habits based on external factors, and I may experiment with intentionally adjusting my coffee intake to evaluate its impact on productivity and energy levels.
