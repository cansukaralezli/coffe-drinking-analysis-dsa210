**MOTIVATION**<br>
  This project's goal is to examine my coffee consumption patterns and how they impact my everyday activities. It also aims to determine how outside variables, such as location, exam weeks, and weather, affect my coffee preferences. Coffee plays a crucial role in my routine, acting as both a productivity booster and a comfort beverage. By studying these patterns, I aim to identify the underlying triggers and impacts of my coffee habits on my life and help me make more informed decisions about my coffee consumption.

**DATA SOURCES**<br>
The datas that I plan to use in my project:
1. Starbucks Data: 
* Includes transaction history, such as purchase dates, times, locations, and the number of loyalty stars earned or redeemed.
* This data provides a record of my coffee consumption behavior over time.
2. Health Application Data:
* I use my Health application to track my step count, I extracted my step counts combined them according to date and will compare it with my Starbucks data.
* This analysis will help me understand how coffee consumption correlates with my physical well-being and productivity.
3. External Data:
* Weather data of the corresponding dates (temperature, precipitation, etc.) collected from online sources.
* Exam schedules and course schedule, workload information (manually recorded).
* Location contexts (e.g., home, university, or travel) based on Starbucks transaction locations.

**OBJECTIVES**<br>
This project aims to:
1. Gain Insight About My Consumption Patterns:
* Analyze when, where, and how frequently I consume coffee.
2. Evaluate Impact of Coffe on Daily Activities:
* Examine the impact of coffee consumption on my daily activity.
3. Analyze External Factors:
* Explore the effects of  outside factors like weather, exam weeks,different weekdays and locations affect my coffee drinking habits.
* Find out whether certain situations (such as stressful weeks or different wheather conditions) affect how much coffee I consume.

**METHADOLOGY**
* Combine Starbucks transaction data with health app metrics and external data sources (weather and exam schedules).
* Ensure all datasets are consistent, fill in missing data points, and align timestamps.
* Visualize coffee consumption trends over time.
* Conduct a detailed analysis of trends, identifying patterns as well as unusual spikes or drops in coffee consumption.
* Identify correlations between coffee habits, daily activities, and external factors.
* Use statistical techniques to quantify relationships (e.g., regression analysis between coffee and health metrics).
* Summarize key findings about my habits and the role coffee plays in my daily life.
